# Readings for computer architecture students

This has a list of papers I must read, from ISCA, IEEE Micro, ACM etc
These have mostly been collected through advice and conversations with
K.S. Pandey or through the lecture slides of Onur Multu from ETH Zurich

Reading Assignments: (In the order mentioned in lectures)
Note: The pfds have either been downloaded or can be read on the eth safari website
